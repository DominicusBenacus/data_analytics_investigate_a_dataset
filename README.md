# Investigate a dataset
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 2

### Project Overview
This is a analyzation of a given datase. Then I communicate my findings about it. I use Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
For this investigation I choose the movie data set. There are others, too. 

### Step One - Choose Your Data Set
Click this to different [data sets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True) to open a document with links and information about data sets that you can investigate for this project. You must choose one of these datasets to complete the project.

### This Projects provides
A PDF or HTML file containing the analysis
* A note specifying which dataset you analyzed
* A statement of the question(s) you posed
* A description of what you did to investigate those questions
* Documentation of any data wrangling you did
* Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results
* Code you used to perform your analysis. If you used a Jupyter notebook, you can submit your .ipynb. Otherwise, you should submit the code separately in .py file(s).
* A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources).

### Learnings
* Know all steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* How to communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
